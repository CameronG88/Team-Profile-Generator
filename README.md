  ## Usage
  This project is to organize personal info and to access contact info quickly.  It is best used when new members are added to a team so all the info can be quickly accessed when needed.

  The only required install to setup is npm inquirer package. Use the code 'npm i inquirer' to get inquirer or 'npm i' to get all dependencies for this application.

  ## How_to_use
  After you make sure you have all the dependencies, run the code 'node app.js' in terminal to generate the team member prompts. Answer all the questions until you have completed inputting your team, then select "No more employees in team". This will then generate your new team profile in an html file called "team.html" in the output folder. Just use your favorite browser to display the html and visualize your team!
